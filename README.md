# Elevator-Verification (Arduino Uno)

Created an automated elevator system using digital logic principles, verified in software, and implemented on physical hardware. 

## Design Process

1. **Logic Design**: Start by designing truth table for transitions.
2. **FSM**: Derived FSM from truth table
3. **Software verification**: Implemented prototype logic on Python and wrote a testbench to validate before taping out on Arduino Uno
4. **Physical implementation**: Rewrote logic with C++ code, and then integrated with Arduino Uno, IR sensors, and 7 segment digit display. 




### Elevator Safety Logic Table

There are 4 states, which is IDLE, MOVING, STOPPING, and SERVICING. 
When Door sensor is 1 it means the door is open. When Request is 1 then the state should be updated to the next state. 

| State | Door | Req | Hardware Action | Next State |
|-------|------|--------|--------|-------------|
| IDLE | 0 | 0 | Display Current Floor | IDLE |
| IDLE | 0 | 1 | Start floor increment | MOVING |
| MOVING | 0 | 0 | Update 7 seg display | MOVING |
| MOVING | 0 | 1 | Stop increment | STOPPING |
| STOPPING | 0 | X | Trigger stop sequence | SERVICING |
| SERVICING | 1 | X | Hold display/timer | SERVICING |
| SERVICING | 0 | 1 | Resume Movement | MOVING |

### Finite State Machine
My FSM is a Moore Machine because the output is tied directly to the current state.

    [*] --> IDLE
    
    IDLE --> MOVING : Door=0, Req=1
    IDLE --> IDLE : Door=0, Req=0
    
    MOVING --> MOVING : Door=0, Req=0
    MOVING --> STOPPING : Door=0, Req=1
    
    STOPPING --> SERVICING : Door=0, X
    
    SERVICING --> SERVICING : Door=1, X
    SERVICING --> MOVING : Door=0, Req=1
```

### Software Verification
In order for the elevator to hit all the floors without missing out on any, I implemented the LOOK disk algorithm to make sure it can traverse accordingly when going up and also traverse down accordingly without going to floors out of order. I prioritized 2 things when validating with python: Making sure that the LOOK algorithm worked and making sure that I can simulate the Limited Memory that the Arduino had so I make sure I am within memory bounds when I eventually tape out in hardware. To simulate how I would run my code on Arduino, I defined registers in my python file and the way I would traverse would be through bitwise shifting rather than rigidly incrementing or decrementing pointers. I wrote a test bench to make sure my code can work with limited physical memory and any test cases that could potentially break my elevator. To keep it simple, I made sure my elevator always reset to floor 1 after all requests are done.
